### Remove line(s) in a file with a regex

`-i` for in-place editing, `d` deletes the line(s) if it matches:

```bash
sed -i '/regexPattern/d' myFile
```

### Remove all occurences of a pattern in a file with a regex

`-i` for in-place editing, `s` (for `substitute`) and `g` (for `global`) for all matches:

```bash
sed -i 's/regexPattern/replacementPattern/g' myFile
```
