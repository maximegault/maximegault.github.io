### Clone using a GitLab token

```bash
git clone https://myToken@myGitServer/myRepo.git
```

### Great .gitignore base for Visual Studio

[Great file to start with](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore)

### Certificate problem

The following error can occur: `SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate`. It can happen when it's not the Windows certificate store that is used.
Check the `http.sslBackend` value in the config. If `openssl` is set, this is not good (it means that the openssl bundle certificate strop is used). It's better to have the `schannel` set:

```bash
http.sslbackend=schannel
```

Details on this [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48212753/7445285). Note that it's not possible from WSL.

See [global .gitconfig documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config) for more elements.

### Problems with CRLF/LF on Windows

Windows use CRLF whereas files are with LF on a repository. So, when commiting from Window, we have warnings like:

```text
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in myFile
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory
```

It's possible to have an automatic conversion instead of this warning message. To correct it, add a value in the project's configuration (or in the global one):

```bash
git config --local core.autocrlf input
```

Great explanation and details on SO [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20653073/7445285)

### Avoid to type token at each operation to Gitlab

Check your local configuration:

```bash
git config --local --list
```

The following line:

```text
remote.origin.url=https://myRepoHost.com/myRepo.git
```

The user and its associated token have to be added:

```bash
git config --local remote.origin.url https://myUser:myToken@myRepoHost.com/myRepo.git
```

In order to have in the configuration:

```text
remote.origin.url=https://myUser:myToken@myRepoHost.com/myRepo.git
```
